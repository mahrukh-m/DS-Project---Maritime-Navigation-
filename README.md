# DS-Project---Maritime-Navigation-
maritime navigation and logistics visualization system.
Maps and optimizes cargo ship routes between international ports.
It processes complex oceanic route data — including port origins and destinations, dates,
voyage durations, shipping company details, and docking delays.
The system helps logistics managers or captains select optimal routes by balancing travel
time, fuel cost, and weather impact, while also managing port stays and layover times
efficiently.
